## 💡 Strategy Tips

### For Success

1. **Balance Your Investments**
   - Don't neglect any capability
   - Aim for 60+ across all areas
   - Address weak points early

2. **Think Long-Term**
   - Cheap shortcuts create expensive problems
   - Delayed impacts can be worth the wait
   - Build foundations early

3. **Prioritize Security**
   - Security breaches are costly
   - Can't be bolted on later
   - Invest early and consistently

4. **Operations Enable Success**
   - Monitoring prevents chaos
   - Incident response is critical
   - Observability pays dividends

5. **Governance Matters**
   - Compliance issues halt operations
   - Risk management is essential
   - Policies prevent problems

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Speed at All Costs**
- Choosing only cheap, fast options
- Result: Production disasters

❌ **Over-Engineering**
- Choosing only expensive, comprehensive options
- Result: Miss deadline or go over budget

❌ **Single Focus**
- Only investing in development
- Result: Imbalanced maturity, production issues

❌ **Ignoring Governance**
- "We'll handle compliance later"
- Result: Regulatory problems, audits fail

❌ **No Operations Plan**
- "We'll figure out monitoring in production"
- Result: Can't debug issues, long outages

### Winning Strategies

✅ **Balanced Approach**
- Strategic investments across all areas
- Address critical gaps first
- Build maturity gradually

✅ **Foundation First**
- Invest in infrastructure early
- Security and governance from day one
- Operations setup before production

✅ **Monitor and Adapt**
- Watch your maturity dashboard
- React to weak areas
- Balance speed with stability

## 🔧 Configuration (Optional)

### For AI-Powered Decisions

If you want to use Gemini AI for dynamic decision generation:

1. **Get Google Cloud Credentials:**
   - Create a Google Cloud Project
   - Enable Vertex AI API
   - Create a service account
   - Download credentials JSON

2. **Configure Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION=us-central1
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=credentials.json
   ```

3. **Place Credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Copy your credentials file
   cp ~/Downloads/credentials.json .
   ```

4. **Restart Application:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the app (Ctrl+C)
   # Start again
   python3 app.py
   ```

**Benefits of AI:**
- Contextually relevant decisions
- Adapts to your game state
